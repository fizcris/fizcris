### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cristian Alonso, I am a mechatronics engineer who loves to code, especially things that move.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning and Computer Vision with the Autonomous Driving Udacity Nanodegree and also a bit of React.
- ðŸ”­ ADAS, Autonomous driving, IOT and remote management and instrumentation are interesting topics for me.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that uses CAN bus and anything to do with control systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about c++, Qt, microcontrollers, multibody, vehicle dynamics, control systems, adaptative control, model reference control, PIDs.
